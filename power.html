            Thomas J. Watson’s rise within IBM (then known as the
            Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, or CTR) was swift and
            impactful. Joining the company in 1914, he rapidly ascended to
            become its leader, driving IBM’s transformation into a globally
            recognized brand. Through determination, visionary thinking, and a
            keen sense of corporate identity, Watson overcame numerous
            challenges to establish his authority and set IBM on a path toward
            becoming a dominant force in the technology industry. This section
            details Watson’s journey to becoming CEO, his struggles, and the
            legacy he built as IBM’s powerful, influential leader.

          Thomas J. Watson joined the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company
          (CTR) in 1914, after a successful but tumultuous career at National
          Cash Register (NCR). He was brought in by CTR’s then-president, George
          Fairchild, to improve the company’s struggling sales and establish a
          stronger corporate structure. Watson saw CTR as an opportunity to
          apply his ideas and transform a scattered business into a cohesive,
          customer-focused organization. His initial impressions of CTR were of
          a company with potential but lacking in strong vision and identity.
          Watson introduced sales and training strategies he had developed at
          NCR, establishing a professional, disciplined approach to business
          within CTR. His ideas immediately began transforming CTR’s sales
          culture, earning him respect and quickly positioning him as a critical
          figure within the company. Watson’s initial influence at CTR set the
          foundation for a cultural shift, introducing the disciplined,
          customer-focused ethos that would eventually define IBM.

            Transformation to IBM and Watson’s Ascent to Leadership

          <p class="founding-text">
            In 1924, a decade after Watson joined, he spearheaded the rebranding
            of CTR to International Business Machines (IBM), a name that
            reflected his ambition to create a world-class organization. The
            name change symbolized Watson’s goal of expanding CTR’s reach
            globally and setting a high standard for quality and
            professionalism. Watson encountered resistance to his ideas from
            within the company, with some CTR executives wary of his ambitious
            approach. His focus on high standards and customer service sometimes
            clashed with traditional methods. Despite this, Watson’s relentless
            drive helped him secure full control of the company, where he
            systematically instilled his vision, introducing progressive
            policies and a culture of respect and responsibility. Watson

        <h1 class="founding-heading">Challenges and Establishing Authority</h1>
        <p class="intro-text">
          During his early years leading IBM, Watson faced several economic
          challenges, including the Great Depression. Despite the downturn, he
          maintained the company’s standards and refused to compromise on
          quality or employee welfare. Watson’s efforts to maintain morale
          during the Great Depression, such as ensuring job security and
          employee benefits, won him loyalty and respect from IBM’s workforce.
          To strengthen his authority, Watson introduced policies that fostered
          a disciplined, professional environment. He created strict codes of
          conduct and a dress code that established IBM employees as highly
          professional representatives of the company. Watson’s decision to
          expand IBM’s services globally further cemented his authority. By
          taking IBM to international markets, he positioned the company as a
          global player, a move that was unprecedented for the time. His ability
          to navigate these early challenges without compromising his values
          demonstrated his resilience and commitment to his vision, establishing
          him as a transformative leader in both IBM and the tech industry.
