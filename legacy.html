            Early Career at National Cash Register (NCR)

            WatsoWatson was born in Campbell, New York, in 1874, into a humble
            farming family. His upbringing instilled a strong work ethic and a
            belief in the education and self-improvement. After completing his
            studies at Elmira School of Commerce, he began his career as a
            bookkeeper but soon discovered his natural talent for sales. In
            salesman. His outstanding sales performance quickly earned him a
            promotion to the general sale manger. At NCR, he gained valuable
            experience in aggressive sales techniques, business management, and
            customer relations-skills that would later be instrumental in his
            transformation of IBM.However, his time at NCR ended in controversy.
            in 1912, Watson was convicted in the antitrust case relates to NCR’s
            monopolistic practices. Despite this setback, it ultimately led to
            his significant role at CTR, which would later become IBM.

          In 1895, Watson joined the National Cash Register Company (NCR) as a
          salesman. His outstanding sales performance quickly earned him a
          promotion to the general sale manger. At NCR, he gained valuable
          experience in aggressive sales techniques, business management, and
          customer relations-skills that would later be instrumental in his
          transformation of IBM. However, his time at NCR ended in controversy.
          in 1912, Watson was convicted in the antitrust case relates to NCR’s
          monopolistic practices. Despite this setback, it ultimately led to his
          significant role at CTR, which would later become IBM. Watson
          developed a reputation for his assertive and motivational style,
          encouraging his team to set high standards for themselves. At NCR, he
          introduced rigorous training programs, motivating his sales staff to
          be well-prepared and customer-focused. However, Watson was also
          involved in a controversial anti-competition campaign at NCR. This
          experience ended with a legal challenge, after which Watson left NCR.
          he time at NCR helped Watson hone his skills in sales, team
          management, and corporate culture-building. He learned the importance
          of establishing a strong brand identity and managing customer
          relationships—principles that he carried to IBM.

            Founding Principles and Early Influence at IBM
          </h1>
          <p class="founding-text">
            After joining IBM (then called CTR) in 1914, Watson began to
            introduce the core values and management strategies he had developed
            at NCR. His emphasis on customer service, employee development, and
            innovation quickly became central to IBM’s culture. Watson
            introduced the “THINK” slogan, which encouraged employees to
            approach their work with thoughtfulness and purpose. This motto
            became iconic, symbolizing IBM’s commitment to intelligence and
            strategy. Drawing from his NCR experience, Watson established
            training programs at IBM that emphasized quality, discipline, and
            customer care. He encouraged employees to maintain high standards
            and continuously improve. Watson's understanding of brand identity
            led him to position IBM as a company known for integrity,
            innovation, and reliability. His focus on a strong, unified
            corporate culture became one of IBM’s key strengths. His
            foundational work at IBM set the stage for its transformation into a
            global leader. His commitment to innovation, quality, and customer
            satisfaction became guiding principles that still influence IBM
            today.

          computing. During his tenure, IBM’s revenues grew more than tenfold.
          His legacy was continued by his son, Thomas J. Watson Jr., who led IBM
          into the computer age, making it one of the world's most influential
          technology companies. Beyond business, Watson Sr. was also a
          philanthropist and advocate for education, contributing to causes that
