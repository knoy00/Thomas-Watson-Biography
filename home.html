        <p class="philosophies-text-2">
          Watson was known for his management philosophies, which became the
          back bone of IBM’s corporate culture. His famous slogan,
          <strong style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">“THINK”</strong>,
          encouraged employees to approach problems with a critical and
          innovation mindset. He believed in fostering a corporate culture based
          on respect, customer service and employee empowerment. Watson famously
          said, “If you want to increase your success rate, double your failure
          rate”, underscoring his belief in calculated risk-taking and
          continuous improvement.

            </h3>
            <p class="philosophies-text-2">
              Watson introduced the simple yet powerful motto, “THINK,” to
              inspire IBM employees to approach every problem with
              consideration, innovation, and a solution-oriented mindset. The
              “THINK” slogan became a cultural touchstone within IBM,
              encouraging employees at all levels to engage thoughtfully with
              their work. This principle underpinned IBM’s operations, pushing
              the company to be methodical and purpose-driven, whether designing
              products or solving customer issues. Watson believed that all
              progress begins with thought, and this idea became a guiding
              principle not only for IBM but also as an influential concept in
              business management.

            <p class="philosophies-text">
              In 1914, Watson was hired as the general manager of the
              Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR), a small, struggling
              company that manufactured punch card tabulators. CTR was a merger
              of several companies producing clocks, scales, and tabulating
              machines. The company's product line was diverse, but it lacked
              direction and focus.

              class="philosophies-img"

            />
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="philosophies-text-2">
          Under Watson's leadership, CTR underwent a dramatic transformation. He
          focused the company on the emerging field of data processing,
          promoting the punched-card tabulating machines for business use,
          especially for tasks like accounting and record-keeping. In 1924,
          Watson renamed the company International Business Machines (IBM) to
          reflect its growing aspirations in global markets. Watson’s initial
          influence at CTR set the foundation for a cultural shift, introducing
          the disciplined, customer-focused ethos that would eventually define
          IBM.
